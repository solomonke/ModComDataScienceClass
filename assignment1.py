# Create below programs using Python, You can use Colab/Pycharm/Any other
# 1. Create a Program to find Simple Interest.
# 2. Create a Program to convert degree Celsius to degree Fahrenheit.

# SI = P × R × T, where P = Principal, R = Rate of Interest, and T = Time period

principal = 2000
time = 3
rate = 10

simple_interest = (principal * rate * time) / 100
print(simple_interest)

# Multiply the °C temperature by 1.8. Add 32 to this number.

degree_celcius = 35
temp_in_fah = (degree_celcius * 1.8) + 32

print(temp_in_fah)

# Please attempt the following question:
# 1. Suppose we have a dictionary:
# person = {'john':40, 'peter':45}
# What happens when we try to retrieve a value using the expression print(person['susan']).
